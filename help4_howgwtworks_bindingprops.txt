[00:41] <adlaistevenson> JsStackEmulator.getStackMode() won't let me go further
[00:42] <adlaistevenson> Trying to run with the binding property set causes this error: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/506647/17805571/

[14:10] <niloc132> adlaistevenson: short version, you're doing it wrong
[14:10] <niloc132> that object encapsulates not only the actually set value, but the possible values, and how they are collapsed, etc
[14:11] <niloc132> instead, you should query your ModuleDef object for that BindingProperty object (which _already_ has three different DefinedValues)
[14:11] <niloc132> and then set STRIP as the only actual value
[14:11] <niloc132> (i'm about 80% about that, i'm not familiar with building these programmatically...)
[14:12] <niloc132> (and am just browsing GWT's own source to figure that much)
[14:15] <niloc132> likely you want moduleDef.getProperties().findBindingProp().setValues(new ConditionAll(), "STRIP");
[14:15] <niloc132> ConditionAll with no args meaning "this is always the value"
[14:15] <niloc132> err, findBindingProp() should obviously have the parameter "compiler.stackMode"...
[14:20] <adlaistevenson> Argh. I'm not surprised I was doing it wrong. This makes a lot of sense, adding this to notes about "how GWT works" for when I try tonight.
